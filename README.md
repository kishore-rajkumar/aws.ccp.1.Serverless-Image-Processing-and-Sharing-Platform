# aws.ccp.capstone.Serverless-Image-Processing-and-Sharing-Platform
This project involves building a serverless web application that allows users to upload images, apply basic filters (like grayscale, sepia, blur), and then share the processed images via a unique, shareable link.

# Project Title: Serverless Image Processing and Sharing Platform

# Overview/Summary:
This project demonstrates the development of a scalable and cost-effective serverless web application for users to upload, process, and share images. Leveraging AWS Lambda for image manipulation, Amazon S3 for storage, Amazon API Gateway for API management, and Amazon DynamoDB for metadata, this application showcases a modern, event-driven architecture. The static frontend, hosted on S3 and delivered via CloudFront, ensures high performance and availability.
